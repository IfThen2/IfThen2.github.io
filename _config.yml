intro: |
  I am a software engineer who thrives by working with others who love what they are doing. Getting my start at American Express as an intern laid a crucial foundation. Learning how to program that close to the metal (64-bit zTPF-assembler) as a first programming langauge solidified general concepts that became usefal later on when programming in more abstract languages.
  Since then i've been on a mission to continue to build on that foundation. I am a walking example that programming can be taught to anyone. What makes a good programmer is the ability to think critically to solve problems, and the drive to continue to learn.
  The bottom line is I love to solve problems. Help me to solve yours.
